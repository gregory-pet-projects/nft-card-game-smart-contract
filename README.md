# NFT Card Battle Game
An NFT card battle game based on the Ethereum blockchain and core wallet with Avalanche (C-Chain) testnet is a unique type of game that combines elements of blockchain technology and collectible card games.

The game allows players to collect NFT cards, which are unique digital assets that are stored on the Ethereum blockchain. These cards can then be used to battle other players in the game, with the winner receiving additional rewards in the form of cryptocurrency.

The game is accessed through a core wallet, which provides a secure and easy-to-use interface for managing the player's NFT cards and cryptocurrency. The core wallet also provides access to the Avalanche (C-Chain) testnet, which allows for fast and inexpensive transactions on the blockchain.

Overall, an NFT card battle game based on the Ethereum blockchain and core wallet with Avalanche (C-Chain) testnet is a fun and innovative way to experience the benefits of blockchain technology, while also enjoying the excitement and strategy of a collectible card game.
